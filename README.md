#Flux Coordinate Utilities

These are a few small functions for working with and manipulating unit
coordinates. Each can be used as a Flux code block on
[Flux.io](https://flux.io). NOTE: "code blocks" are only available to a limited
number of users on Flux.

To use this module as a code block, create a new code block, Edit it, and paste
in the contents of any of the blocks in this repo. The inputs and outputs of the
code block should match that of the JSDoc for the `run` function in the source
file in question (e.g. "coordinates" in and "coordinates" & "overlaps" out for
coordinateOverlaps.js).

To run tests, fork/clone and run:
```
npm install
npm run test
```
